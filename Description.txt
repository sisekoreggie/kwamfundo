This is my own personal project.

Personal Project Description

I wanna create an app for the Kwamfundo Senior Secondary School, 
which can allow parents to register or apply for their children in the school. 
Even though the main purpose and inspiration behind the whole app creation is the online application form, 
the app will also have information about the school, staff like meetings, 
sport outings, teacher contact details, school contact details and mission, 
overall report of the performance for learners, 
and also the app will have an online interactive platform from which learners can ask questions about problems in a blog, 
say specifically in a Mathematics section and then any teacher or learner or other students who registered as tutors in the app can answer his/her question.
