This is my own personal project.

Personal Project Description

I wanna create an app for the Kwamfundo Senior Secondary School, 
which can allow parents to register or apply for their children in the school. 
Even though the main purpose and inspiration behind the whole app creation is the online application form, 
the app will also have information about the school, staff like meetings, 
sport outings, teacher contact details, school contact details and mission, 
overall report of the performance for learners, 
and also the app will have an online interactive platform from which learners can ask questions about problems in a blog, 
say specifically in a Mathematics section and then any teacher or learner or other students who registered as 
tutors in the app can answer his/her question.

Goals 
Problem Space
 1. Parents have to go to long lines in January to apply for their children thus they 
    have to take a day or more off from their work.
 2. Some learners while practising/studying at home would need assistance on what they are currently studying
 3. Some parents dont have contact details of the school
 4. Some parents forget some meetings, as they are ussually given printed letters.
 
Solutions
 1. Provide an online application form for parents to complete.
 2. Provide a blog where they can post questions and be answered.
 3. Provide all the contact info of the school.
 4. Post the meetings on the app and have alert parents the day before the meeting.
